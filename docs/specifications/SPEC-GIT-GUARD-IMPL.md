## 8. Rust Implementation Details

### 8.1 Crate Structure

```
rust-guard/
├── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.lock
├── .cargo/
│   └── config.toml          # target = x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
└── src/
    └── main.rs              # multi-module binary (~500 LOC)
```

A single package is preferred over multiple crates for a single guard binary.

### 8.2 Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = "0.2"    # for getauxval, execve, stat, getpwuid, prctl
```

No other dependencies. Argument parsing is manual. No `clap`, no `thiserror`, no `anyhow`. The standard library is sufficient.

### 8.3 Unsafe Blocks

Only two `unsafe` blocks are needed:

1. **`getauxval(AT_SECURE)`** — libc FFI call:
   ```rust
   // SAFETY: getauxval is a standard libc function. AT_SECURE is a valid
   // auxiliary vector key defined by the ELF ABI. Returns 0 if not found.
   let at_secure = unsafe { libc::getauxval(libc::AT_SECURE) };
   ```

2. **`execve()`** — libc FFI call with C strings:
   ```rust
   // SAFETY: git_path, argv_c, and envp_c are all valid null-terminated
   // CStrings. Their pointers remain valid for the duration of the call.
   // execve does not return on success.
   let ret = unsafe {
       libc::execve(git_path.as_ptr(), argv_ptr, envp_ptr)
   };
   ```

### 8.4 Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "rust-guard"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"        # optimise for size
lto = true             # link-time optimisation
codegen-units = 1      # single codegen unit for better optimisation
panic = "abort"        # no unwinding in SUID binary
strip = true           # strip symbols

[dependencies]
libc = "0.2"
```

### 8.5 Build Target

Primary target: `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (statically linked).

Static linking eliminates shared library injection vectors — there are no `.so` files to preload or replace. The binary is fully self-contained.

If musl toolchain is unavailable, fall back to `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (dynamically linked). In that case, only `libc` and the musl-compatible minimal set of libraries are linked.

### 8.6 Resource Limits

Before `execve()`, the guard sets:
- `RLIMIT_NOFILE` to 256 — limits open file descriptors
- `RLIMIT_CORE` to 0 — disables core dumps (prevents memory disclosure from SUID context)

Set via `libc::prctl()` and `libc::setrlimit()`.

### 8.7 Error Handling Strategy

The guard uses a simple `Result` type with explicit exit codes:

```rust
enum GuardError {
    NotSuid,              // exit 3
    GitOriginalMissing,   // exit 3
    GitOriginalBadPerms,  // exit 3
    NullByteInArg,        // exit 2
    Blocked { reason: String, hint: String },  // exit 1
    ContractFailed,       // exit 4
}
```

No panics. `panic = "abort"` in release mode. Any unexpected condition is treated as a block (fail-closed) rather than a crash.

## 9. Security Threat Model

### 9.1 Threats Mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| User runs `git reset --hard` | Subcommand deny-list (§4, check 1) |
| User runs `git checkout main` | Subcommand deny-list (§4, check 1) |
| User runs `git push --force` | Flag deny-list (§4, check 3c) |
| User bypasses pre-commit hooks via `SKIP=1` | Env var sanitisation (§5.1) |
| User sets `-c core.hooksPath=/tmp/evil` | Config key block list (§4, check 3) |
| User puts malicious binary in PATH | PATH reset (§5.2) |
| User compiles own git wrapper and runs it | AT_SECURE check (§2.2) |
| User reads guard binary to find git.original path | git.original is 0700 root-only (§2.1) |
| User tries to exec git.original directly | Permission denied (0700 root:root) |
| User uses `LD_PRELOAD` to inject code | Env var unset (§5.1) + static linking |
| User pushes from CI script to bypass hooks | Background push detection (§4, check 4d) |
| User amends a pushed commit | Ancestor check via merge-base (§4, check 4e) |
| User reverts un-pushed work | Ancestor check (§4, check 4f) |
| User creates merge commit on main | Protected branch rule (§4, check 5) |
| User deletes .pre-commit-config.yaml then pushes | P3 contract check (§6.2) |
| User installs alternate git via apt | dpkg-divert prevents overwrite (§5.2 in SPEC-GIT-GUARD-INSTALL) |
| User accesses git via snap/flatpak | Snap/flatpak git binaries restricted to 000 (§12.1 in SPEC-GIT-GUARD-INSTALL) |
| User downloads git binary from upstream | PATH controlled; git at `/usr/bin` is the only canonical path. Pre-commit hooks detect unapproved git usage |
| User modifies .bashrc to add PATH bypass | PATH is reset by the guard before execve (§5.2). The guard does not trust the invoking environment |
| User replaces guard binary with own version | SUID bit set by root only; immutable attribute `chattr +i` prevents modification (§12.3 in SPEC-GIT-GUARD-INSTALL) |
| User modifies dpkg to remove diversion | Apt post-invoke hook detects and warns (§5.6 in SPEC-GIT-GUARD-INSTALL). Divert is root-only operation |
| User compiles git from source | Source compile goes to `/usr/local/bin/git` which is restricted to 000 (§12.1 in SPEC-GIT-GUARD-INSTALL) |

### 9.2 Threats NOT Mitigated (root-level attacks)

| Threat | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| User has root access | Root can remove SUID bit, reinstall git, remove diversion, etc. The guard protects against workspace users, not root. Root access IS a security boundary violation — all root actions are audited. |
| Kernel exploit | Out of scope. If the kernel is compromised, no user-space mechanism helps. |
| Hardware-level attack | Out of scope. |

### 9.3 Defense in Depth Layers

The guard implements multiple independent layers of defense:

1. **SUID Root** — Only the guard can invoke real git; real git is 0700 root:root
2. **Argument Validation** — All args parsed and validated before execve
3. **Environment Sanitisation** — Allow-list approach; no dangerous env vars passed through
4. **PATH Reset** — Known-safe PATH prevents PATH injection
5. **dpkg-divert** — Prevents apt from overwriting the guard
6. **Immutable Attribute** — `chattr +i` prevents filesystem-level tampering
7. **Apt Hook** — Detects git package changes and warns
8. **Pre-commit Hooks** — Second layer of defense at the repo level
9. **Audit Logging** — All blocks logged with timestamps, UIDs, and commands
10. **Static Linking** — No shared library injection vectors
11. **Resource Limits** — RLIMIT_CORE=0, RLIMIT_NOFILE=256 limit blast radius

### 9.4 Blast Radius

If the guard binary has a bug that allows arbitrary code execution with root privileges:
- The binary is ~500 LOC — small audit surface
- Static linking removes shared library attack vectors
- No network I/O, no file parsing, no deserialisation
- No heap allocations from untrusted input (argv is bounded)
- `RLIMIT_CORE=0` prevents core dump analysis
- `RLIMIT_NOFILE=256` limits file descriptor exhaustion
- The only privileged operation is `execve()` of a known-good binary

The worst-case RCE allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands as root — which they could already do if they compromised the real git binary. The guard doesn't increase the blast radius beyond what the existing SUID model already allows.

## 10. File Layout

|------|---------|
| `/usr/bin/git` | rust-guard SUID binary (installed) |
| `/usr/bin/git.original` | real git binary (relocated, 0700 root:root) |
| `projects/RUST-GUARD/` | Rust source code repository |
| `projects/RUST-GUARD/src/main.rs` | Multi-module Rust implementation |
| `projects/RUST-GUARD/Cargo.toml` | Package manifest |
| `projects/RUST-GUARD/Cargo.lock` | Locked dependencies |
